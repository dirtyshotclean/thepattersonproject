        <h3>What Happened?</h3>
        <p>On <span class="highlight">June 24, 2022</span>, a crew of filmmakers went missing while making a found footage horror film at a timeshare in Camp Nelson, CA. They were there to make a documentary about the unexplained events that had been reported in the area over the past decade. The crewâ€™s final footage was recovered, but it left more questions than answers.</p>
        
        <p>Many believe that something supernatural was involved, while others suspect foul play. What is certain is that their footage revealed strange and terrifying encounters with an unknown force.</p>

        <h3>The Final Footage</h3>
        <p>While the footage was recovered, much of it was corrupted. However, some disturbing fragments were found, showing the filmmakers terrified and running through the dense woods. Audio recordings suggest they were pursued by something unseen, something that could not be explained by traditional means.</p>
        <p>We may never know what truly happened that day, but the footage, and the eerie silence that followed, will haunt those who dared to venture too close to Camp Nelson.</p>
